# How to Contribute

Thanks for the interest in contributing. I highly encourage people to contribute to this project if they're interested.
If you want to discuss any features, feel free to file an issue or find me on discord or Reddit. 
In general, I welcome issues and pull requests. I may not get to all the issues as this is a personal project, but they're good to track.

## Beginner issues

Check out the issue tracker. Issues tagged "Good First Issue" should be relatively straightfoward. The issues tagged "Help Wanted" are typically slightly trickier and require more specialized knowledge of either Raku or Typescript and would be a huge help. Feel free to reach out if any ticket interests you.

## Syntax Highlighting
The syntax highlighting has some bugs in it, and these should ideally be centralized at the atom repo itself. https://github.com/Raku/atom-language-perl6
This i repo is also used for Github syntax highlighting, so is an important upstream repo.

## Language Server
The language server is the primary development item in this repo. Ideally, it would progress to match (or even surpass) the features present in the Perl Navigator. Note that many of the Perl Navigator features are not contained within the project, such as Perl::Critic and Perl::Tidy. Similar integrations would be more than welcome for this language server as well.
